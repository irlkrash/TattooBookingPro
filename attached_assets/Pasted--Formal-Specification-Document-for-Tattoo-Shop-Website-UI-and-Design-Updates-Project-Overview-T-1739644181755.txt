# Formal Specification Document for Tattoo Shop Website UI and Design Updates

## Project Overview
This document outlines the requested UI and design updates for the tattoo shop's booking and showcase website hosted on Replit. The goal is to improve the overall user experience, streamline the admin dashboard design configuration, and ensure a consistent design throughout the site.

## 1. Header and Navigation Consolidation

### Current Structure:
- **Header Section:** Displays primary navigation links (`Tattoo Studio`, `Gallery`, `Admin Dashboard`).
- **Nav Section:** Displays the shop name (`Luna's Mark Tattoos`) with different design elements.

### Requested Change:
1. **Remove the Nav Section:**
   - Completely remove the Nav Section from the website.
2. **Apply Nav Section Design Elements to the Header Section:**
   - Transfer all design properties from the Nav Section to the Header Section, including:
     - Background color
     - Text color
     - Font size and style
     - Padding and spacing adjustments
3. Ensure that the Header Section remains the primary navigation element and maintains a visually appealing and consistent design.

## 2. Admin Dashboard Design Configuration Updates

### A. Header Design Fields
**Current Location:** 
- These fields are located under the **Home Section** in the Design Configuration panel.

**Requested Change:** 
- Move all header-related design fields to a new, dedicated **Header Section** in the Design Configuration panel.
- Ensure the following fields are included under the new Header Section:
  - Header Background Color
  - Header Text Color
  - Additional relevant design fields specifically related to the header styling.

### B. Featured Section Design Fields
**Current Issue:**
- Several design fields for a "Featured Section" appear under the **Home Section** in the Design Configuration panel, but no such section exists on the main page.

**Requested Change:**
- Remove all design fields related to the Featured Section from the Home Section in the Design Configuration panel.

## 3. Summary of Requested Changes
1. **UI/UX Consolidation:**
   - Remove redundant elements (Nav Section).
   - Transfer and apply relevant design properties to the Header Section.
2. **Admin Dashboard Organization:**
   - Reorganize design fields for clarity and logical grouping.
   - Eliminate unused design fields to reduce clutter and potential confusion.
3. **Consistency and Simplicity:**
   - Ensure that design changes result in a clean, consistent, and user-friendly interface.
